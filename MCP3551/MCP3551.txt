This library is developed to connect ADC converters (MCP3551/3) to an Arduino.
It uses two functions:
- startConversion()
- waitConversion()
The first function starts the conversion in single conversion mode.
The second function wait for the conversion to be completed or a time-out.
This two function approach makes it possible to use the time between startConversion and waitConversion for other stuff.

MCP3551/3 is a single channel ADC (22 bits) can be combined with a octal bi-directional switch (74HCT4051).
Note: the octal switch still has some resistance in on state.
